vagrant & veewee
================

This project was born to test the substitution of heartbeat:drbdlinksclean
with ocf:heartbeat:symlink in an old Xen cluster based on CentOS 5.X dom0.
All the domU are Debian 5.0.6 and we have used veewee to test
ocf:heartbeat:symlink in a downgrade environment with pacemaker and
corosync. We have made only a little change.

Thank you for all
